https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/8227#issuecomment-1793513579  
Try using an incognito window if you have trouble

### Playlists
Make sure you don't copy video links from a playlist view, this creates a download loop the size of playlist  
Check for urls ending in `&list={list_id}&index={index_id}` and delete this segment of the url if needed

## [TODO]
- Parallelize the process
