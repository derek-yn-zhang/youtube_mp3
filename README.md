## User Notes

### Cookies
Make sure you are signed into YouTube from a yt-dlp supported browser (check CLI usage for options).  

If using Safari, give Full Disk Access to Terminal. [[Issue]](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/7392#issuecomment-1657496651)  

Try using an incognito window if you have trouble. [[Issue]](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/8227#issuecomment-1793513579)  

### Playlists
Make sure you don't copy video links from a playlist view, this creates a download loop the size of playlist.  
Check for urls ending in `&list={list_id}&index={index_id}` and delete this segment of the url if needed.

## `[TODO]`
- Thread process
- Handle playlists
- Option to load directly to Spotify local files
